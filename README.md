## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems Encountered

- Could not install Tailwind CSS locally, so I used the CDN from the official website.
- Faced network issues while trying to host the site.
- Made a mistake with the same email during SSL certification, causing delays.
- Encountered issues pushing files via HTTPS; switched to SSH instead.
